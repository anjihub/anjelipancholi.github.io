  My name is Anjeli Pancholi, and I've been passionate about computers since I was seven years old, when I first started playing video games with my brother.
  That early fascination sparked a lifelong interest in technology and set me on a path toward a career in computing.
  I'm currently studying computer science with a focus on cybersecurity and digital forensics. My goal is to work in cybersecurity within law enforcement,
  where I can combine my passion for justice and protecting others with my technical skills. Iâ€™m especially interested in using technology to support the greater good,
  whether through forensic investigation, ethical hacking, or building tools that help keep people safe.
