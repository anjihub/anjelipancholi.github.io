        description: |
          Visualizing network security attack flows with Mermaid diagrams to simplify complex concepts.  
          This project uses Mermaid, a markdown-friendly diagram tool, to create clear and concise sequence diagrams illustrating a botnet attack scenario.  
          It helped me practice representing cybersecurity processes visually and enhanced my understanding of attack-defense interactions.
